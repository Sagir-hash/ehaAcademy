    <h1>The inside story: Why is Oh Noes so sad?</h1>

    <p>We had an exclusive interview with Oh Noes guy, the error buddy, and we asked him the question that all of you were wondering about: "Why do you always seem so sad?" Here's his shocking reply:</p>
    <p id="ohnoes-says"></p>

    <p>We asked Winston for comment, and this is all he would say about it:</p>
    <p id="winston-says"></p>
    <script>
        var ohnoesSays = document.getElementById("ohnoes-says");
        var winstonSays = document.getElementById("winston-says");

        var ohnoesSays = querySelectorAll("ohnoes-says");
        var winstonSays = querySelectorAll("winston-says");

        for (var i = 0; i < ohnoesSays.lenght; i++) {
            ohnoesSays[i].innerHTML = "He is a good <em>programmer</em>, but was <strong>quarantined</strong> in Maiduguri.";
        }
    </script>
